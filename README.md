AI design pattern explorations for Trust &amp; Safety applications

## Introduction

The rise of generative AI tools has brought about a new set of content abuse problems for platforms and the services that create text, images, video, and audio content using artificial intelligence. 

While the underlying technology is relatively new, the discipline of Trust & Safety has developed a wealth of knowledge and experience about identifying and mitigating risks related to problematic types of content. 

This document is intended to explore the application of Trust & Safety product thinking to a subset of the problems related to generative AI technology.
